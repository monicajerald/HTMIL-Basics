    <p></em>Obviously, we are not saying that it is possible to be happy all of the time.<br> But many people manage to live
        in an overall state of happiness. But how do we achieve this?</em></p>
    <p>When life feels overwhelmingly negative, it is easy to lose sight of how important happiness is. <br>Most of the
        time people aren’t even aware, that they are the root of their own unhappiness.</p>
    <p>More importantly, they are completely unaware that it is within their power to change. <br>They don’t understand
        that happiness comes from within, but that it is a journey, taken one step at a time.</p>

        Feeling happy is vitally important in life. It has many fringe benefits. When you are happy, you tend to attract
        happy people to you. Happy people tend to be emotionally and physically healthier, more compassionate, creative,
        and energetic.Generally, if you are happy, people tend to want to spend more time with you. When you are
        surrounded by
        positive, happy, creative, and energetic people you will see that the quality of your life improves. The more
        you spend with happy positive people the more will find that most of these people are also financially
        successful too.
